# Development Notes & Learning Log

## Date: January 5, 2026

### Today's Focus

- Complete list_utils functions

### Ideas & Thoughts

- Completed the remove_duplicates function
    - Can make a couple improvements
    - This is an inefficient solution O(n^2)
    - Also need to finalize the preserve_order behavior (no sorting, only duplicate removal)


### Questions

- 

### Learnings

- Use dictionary to reduce processing
- Sets or dicts are always better than lists for membership testing

### To Explore

- Dicts/Sets: Compute a hash of the item → jump directly to that hash bucket → instant lookup
    - Explore more about how that works
